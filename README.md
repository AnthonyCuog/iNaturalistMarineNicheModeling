# iNaturalistMarineNicheModeling

This code uses a combination of iNaturalist observations and other publically available data to infer niche space and distributions of Rhizostome jellyfishes

We hope this serves as an outline to apply similar methodologies to other marine organisms

All necessary data is included, and the code has been confirmed to work across multiple computers. 
However, slight directory changes or command modifications (due to version differences) may be necessary to successfully run the code locally.

Message me if you need help implementing the work flow locally, and we hope you find our research valuable.

If you use this code, we would appreciate a citation for the associated manuscript: TBD
